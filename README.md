## 🚀 Features

- **Image Upload Mode**: Upload an image to classify it as a cat or a dog.
- **Real-Time Camera Mode**: Use your webcam to classify live images of cats and dogs.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built with TensorFlow using transfer learning for high accuracy.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface.

## 🛠 Installation

### 1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Code Block Fix**: The `pip install -r requirements.txt` command was missing the closing backtick for the code block, causing a formatting issue.
2. **Proper Markdown Formatting**: Ensured that the markdown is structured with headings and subsections, which makes it visually appealing.
3. **Model Download Link**: Included the placeholder `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-GJtoo4UiNt1PegTuCgcwggDiD_AKV1O/view?usp=drive_link` which should be replaced with the actual link to the pre-trained model.
4. **Images Placeholder**: The screenshot sections now have placeholders like `images/home_page.png`, which you should update to the correct path to your image files.

### Result:
Now the **README.md** should render cleanly with all sections and be easily readable on GitHub. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
